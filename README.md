A react component library in typescript

This is a new component library that I will be working on over time. I would say that this is not currently ready for production use. If your interested in helping develop this repository/npm module please feel free to reach out to me.

The goal is to build an incredibly versitile component library that is incredibly diverse and has multiple different types of componets that could fit any situation. I will be making some basic guidelines for components, however my goals is to a vast library of differnt components that if you were to look through the source code it would be like looking through a wizards spellbook. 

Basic construction is includes:
Typescript base,
CSS modules for styling
--A base of css grid for design with a potentinal idea for creating input grid templates for ultimate customization--
